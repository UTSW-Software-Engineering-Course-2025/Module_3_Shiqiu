This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and one intracytoplasmic catalytic domain, thus belongs to receptor type PTP. The extracellular region of this PTP is composed of multiple fibronectin type_III repeats, which was shown to interact with neuronal receptor and cell adhesion molecules, such as contactin and tenascin C. This protein was also found to interact with sodium channels, and thus may regulate sodium channels by altering tyrosine phosphorylation status.

       "\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. I remember that this is a classic question in physics. Let me think about the correct explanation.\\n\\nFirst, I recall that sunlight is white, but it's actually a mixture of all the colors in the visible spectrum. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules and small particles in the air. The key here is Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light.\\n\\nBlue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors like red or yellow. Because of this, blue light is scattered more efficiently by the molecules in the atmosphere. So when sunlight reaches the Earth, the blue light is scattered in all directions, making the sky appear blue during the day.\\n\\nBut wait, I should check if there are other factors. For example, during sunrise or sunset, the sky appears red or orange. That's because the sunlight has to pass through more of the atmosphere, so the blue light is scattered away, and the longer wavelengths like red and orange dominate. That makes sense.\\n\\nAlso, the human eye is more sensitive to blue light, which might be another reason why we perceive the sky as blue. But I think the primary reason is the scattering of shorter wavelengths.\\n\\nI should make sure I'm not mixing up any other phenomena. Maybe mention that the atmosphere is composed of nitrogen and oxygen, which are the main components. The scattering by these molecules is what causes the effect.\\n\\nSo the answer should explain that sunlight is white, but when it scatters in the atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (blue) are scattered more, leading to the blue color we see. Also, mention that this is Rayleigh scattering and that the eye is more sensitive to blue, but the main reason is the scattering of shorter wavelengths.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, which involves how sunlight interacts with the molecules and small particles in Earth's atmosphere. Here's a breakdown of the process:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight Composition**:  \\n   Sunlight is white light, composed of all visible wavelengths (from red to violet). However, it's not perfectly even—blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy than red light.\\n\\n2. **Scattering in the Atmosphere**:  \\n   When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen) and small particles. These collisions scatter the light in all directions. The key here is the **wavelength** of the light:  \\n   - **Shorter wavelengths** (blue and violet) are scattered **much more strongly** than longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow).  \\n   - This is because the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (Rayleigh scattering formula: $ I \\\\propto 1/\\\\lambda^4 $).\\n\\n3. **Why We See Blue**:  \\n   - While violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and the sun emits more blue light than violet.  \\n   - The scattered blue light fills the sky, making it appear blue during the day.\\n\\n4. **Exceptions (Sunrise/Sunset)**:  \\n   - During sunrise or sunset, sunlight travels through a thicker layer of the atmosphere. This means the blue light is scattered out of the direct path, leaving the longer wavelengths (red, orange) to dominate, which is why the sky appears red or orange at those times.\\n\\n5. **Why Not Purple?**:  \\n   - Although violet light is scattered more than blue, the sun emits less violet light, and the human eye is less sensitive to it. Additionally, the atmosphere absorbs some violet light, further reducing its visibility.\\n\\n**In summary**: The sky appears blue because shorter wavelengths of light (blue) are scattered more efficiently by the molecules in the atmosphere, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue. This scattering effect is called Rayleigh scattering.\""
